Scripts to reduce data from large radio telescopes (GMRT, VLA)

These scripts run the MIRIAD package for the reduction of interferometric (mult-dish) data (https://www.atnf.csiro.au/computing/software/miriad/). While this is fine for the six dish Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), which has 15 antenna baseline pairs and limited bandwidth, for the large interfometers - the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT, http://www.gmrt.ncra.tifr.res.in) and Very Large Array (VLA, https://public.nrao.edu/telescopes/vla/), up to 30 dishes (435 antenna pairs) and very low frequnecies (for hydrogen at high redshift) in a hostile radio frequency environment, mean that  some automation is required.
